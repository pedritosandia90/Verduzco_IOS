This is a list of 5 things I learned developing this code.

1. Creating a login app in Flutter: Through this code, you have learned how to create a simple login app using the Flutter framework. You've seen how to design the user interface, manage navigation between screens, and work with forms.

2.Managing state in Flutter: You have learned how to manage the state of the application using setState().
The state of the application changes when the user logs in or registers, and this affects the user interface that is displayed.

3. Form Validation: You have seen how to add form validation in Flutter using Form and TextFormField.
This ensures that users provide valid information before logging in or registering.

4. Using Text Controllers: You have used TextEditingController to manage text entry in the username and password fields. This allows access and manipulation of the values entered by the user in those fields.

5. Navigation between screens: You have learned how to navigate between different screens of the application using the Navigator widget.
When the user logs in successfully, a welcome screen is displayed, and when the user logs out, they return to the login form.
